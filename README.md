# ReCirc
ReCirc is a R based computational method to re-annotate probes of widely used commercial non-circRNA microarrays to identify circRNAs. It supports multiple microarrays, and can identify circRNAs from the body as well as the back-spliced junction sequence of circRNAs. The code ReCirc_body.r listed here is to identify circRNAs with ReCirc with circRNAs body sequences. The code creactecirc_junc.r is to cut 24bp from the head and tail of circRANs respectively and then joint them together to create junction database for each circRNAs. The code ReCirc_junction.r is to identify circRNAs with ReCirc with circRNAs junction sequences.
